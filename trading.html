<h1>My trading education.</h1>
<br>
<p>Like almost everyone elses trading career, it began on YouTube. Trying to learn harmonic patterns, to following EMA lines, and even buying signals or useless courses.
Within a very short amount of time I realized those things just were not the way the market works. Countinuing my search on how to become profitable in the markets,
I came across Instituional trading. That was around 3 years ago and i've been stufying, and profitable ever since. I will post a few trade examples down below. </p>
